# Overview

This document provides a quick overview of the repositories/ tools used in the README.md for your GitHub profile,
along with a setup guide if you wish to integrate the repos into your own GitHub profile and customize them to your own liking.

Follow these steps to setup your own GitHub profile:

**Create a Repository**: Create a repository with your unique `$GitHubusername`.

**Include README.md**: Include or create a README.md file in your repository.

**Push Changes**: Push the changes to your repository.

## Customize the README.md

You can now proceed to add your own customization to the readme where mine utilizes the following structure:

### 1. Visitor Badge
I use the [Visitor Badge](https://github.com/hehuapei/visitor-badge) to count all visitors. 
The Visitor Badge have a broad range of features and can be used with both HTML and Markdown Language.
To use add your `$username` & the `$repo.id` of the repository you wish to count visitors from.

### 2. Typing Svg 
This repository is used for the *Welcome Message* and uses the [Typing Svg](https://github.com/DenverCoder1/readme-typing-svg) repository by DenverCoder1. 
This repo makes it possible to present live text in the SVG format where different messages can be written out and added in the MD or HTML format.. 

## 3. Bio Description
In this section i mainly emojis from [Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org) and plain text.

## 4. Social Media Links
To link to different plattforms i use the [Badges](https://github.com/alexandresanlim/Badges4-README.md-Profile) from the alexandresalin repo.
To use the badges visit the repo find the badge you want to use copy `![image]({BadgeURLHere})` and paste it onto your profile
If you want the badges to leed somewhere, simply add an a-tag with the prefered destination.

### 5. Toolbox
Using the [SkillIcons](https://github.com/tandpfun/skill-icons) to visually represent some of my skills. To use them yourself,
visit the repository and see the icons. Your skills can be displayed by referencing the icons like this `?i=js,css,typescript`

### 6. Contributions
For the contributions im using the [Snk](https://github.com/Platane/snk) to use, visit the repo, either generate a svg, gif or a new 
image each day by using the github actions.

### 7. GitHub Stats
This repository integrates the [github-readme-streak-stats](https://github.com/DenverCoder1/github-readme-streak-stats) repository by DenverCoder1.
